# Vulkan minimal compute

### What?

An ultra simple demo of compute with Vulkan.

Specifically a compute shader to render the mandelbrot set.

### Who?

For those looking to learn Vulkan.

### How?

1. `..\vulkan_minimal_compute> cmake -B./build -S./`
2. Open solution
3. Right click `vulkan_minimal_compute` project, `Set as Startup Project`
4. Run
5. See `..\vulkan_minimal_compute\mandelbrot.png` got created

### What's different about this fork?

- Comments condensed
- Validation layers removed
- Bunch of stuff scoped

Overall, it's smaller and simpler, what imho a minimal example shuld be.
